# Dataset-Tomato-Fruit
I created this dataset for training an artificial intelligence for tomato detection, this dataset has individual images of tomatoes in various stages of ripening as well as actual images of the tomato plants in the greenhouses.Here you also have the csv files with the respective boundingboxes of the tomatoes and the labels ("T_Catch") for tomatoes that are ready to catch and the label ("T_N_Catch") for tomatoes that are not ready to catch, and the respective filename of the image in question.  This dataset is divided into training and testing. Also present are the ".record" files for training and for tests used to train the AI with the Tensorflow library, for this conversion from ".csv" to ".record" we used the script also present in the folder.
