# Dataset-Tomato-Fruit
I created this dataset for training an artificial intelligence for tomato detection, this dataset has individual images of tomatoes in various stages of ripening as well as actual images of the tomato plants in the greenhouses. Here you also have the json files with the respective boundingboxes of the tomatoes and the labels ("T_Apanhar") for the tomato that is ready to be picked and the label ("T_N_Apanhar") for the tomato that is not ready to be picked, also has a csv file with all the previous information, boundingboxes labels and the filename of the image in question. This dataset is divided into training and testing.
